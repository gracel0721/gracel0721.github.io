    <h1>Hi! I'm Grace</h1>

    <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture"> 
    <p>I am a 22 year old software engineer based in North NJ. This is my personal website. I created this website to showcase my projects and skills, and to brush up on my front end development skills in the process.</p>
    <h2><a href="./Monica_1_0_0/about.html">About Me</a></h2>
    <p>I have a passion for creating interactive and user-friendly web applications. I am also trying to break into the world of firmware and embedded systems engineering (which is like the complete opposite of web dev) In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, traveling, crocheting, playing with my cat, Wayne, and exploring new technologies. I am also in the process of getting my Comprehensive Pilates Teacher Certification.</p>
