I am a 22 year old software engineer based in North NJ. This is my personal website. I created this website to showcase my projects and skills, and to brush up on my front end development skills in the process. I have an interest in firmware and embedded systems engineering (which is like the complete opposite of web dev). In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, traveling, crocheting, playing with my cat, Wayne, and exploring new technologies. I am also in the process of getting my Comprehensive Pilates Teacher Certification.
